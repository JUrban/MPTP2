<H3>Architecture</H3>

MaLARea 0.3 [Urb07, USPV08] is a metasystem for ATP in large theories
where symbol and formula names are used consistently.
It uses several deductive systems (now E,SPASS,Paradox,Mace),
as well as complementary AI techniques like machine learning 
(the SNoW system) based on symbol-based similarity, model-based
similarity, term-based similarity, and obviously previous
successful proofs.

<H3>Strategies</H3>

The basic strategy is to run ATPs on problems, then use the machine learner
to learn axiom relevance for conjectures from solutions, and use
the most relevant axioms for next ATP attempts. This is iterated,
using different timelimits and axiom limits. Various features
are used for learning, and the learning is complemented by other criteria
like model-based reasoning, symbol and term-based similarity, etc.

<H3>Implementation</H3>

The metasystem is implemented in ca. 2500 lines of Perl. It uses
many external programs - the above mentioned ATPs and machine learner,
TPTP utilities, LADR utilities for work with models, and some standard
Unix tools.

MaLARea is available at

The metasystem's Perl code is released under GPL2.

<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

Thanks to machine learning, MaLARea is strongest on batches 
of many related problems with many redundant axioms where
some of the problems are easy to solve and can be used for 
learning the axiom relevance. MaLARea is not very good
when all problems are too difficult (nothing to learn from),
or the problems (are few and) have nothing in common. Some of 
its techniques (selection by symbol and term-based similarity, 
model-based reasoning) could however make it even there slightly
stronger than standard ATPs. MaLARea has a very good performance
on the MPTP Challenge, which is a predecessor of the LTB division.
