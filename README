MPTP 0.19 (Mizar Problems for Theorem Proving)

This is a preliminary, incomplete and experimental 
version of MPTP 0.2 - use it at your own risk.

Installation:
-------------

- Unpack, set the variable mml_dir at the top of utils.pl 
  to the location of the unpacked 'pl' directory in the distro.
- If you want to work with the XML files too, unpack the file
  xml.tar.gz. It will take almost 2GB.
- The prolog files are tested only with SWI Prolog 5.2 now.
- Load utils.pl into SWI.
- Try generating 'by' problems for first 100 MML articles by 
  running mk_first100/0.
- Try running latest EPROVER (www.eprover.org) on the problems
  (the --tstp-in flag is needed).
- That's it for now. For working with the prolog files 
  study/extend utils.pl for your needs. Or work directly with 
  the rich XML files (directory 'xml').
